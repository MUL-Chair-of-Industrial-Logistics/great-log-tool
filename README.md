# GrEAt-Log-Tool
The Green Evaluation of Alternatives for Logistics (GrEAt-Log) Tool is a multi-criteria decision-making tool that enables decision-makers in logistics to list and evaluate decarbonization options for their logistics processes. It was developed during a PhD thesis based on empirical work among Austrian and German Industrial Logistics practitioners. 
The publication describing the development of the tool is currently being written and will be published soon.
